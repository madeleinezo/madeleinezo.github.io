# Célia Rohart - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About 
Hi, I'm Célia, a data enthusiast with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. With a diverse background spanning law, marketing, and data analysis, I bring a rich tapestry of skills to the table. This multidisciplinary journey has honed my analytical acumen, fostered strategic thinking, and cultivated a profound understanding of the digital terrain. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

My professional background encompasses diverse industries, including audiovisual and fintech, providing me with extensive experience in data analysis. Additionally, I have demonstrated proficiency in project management, interdisciplinary teamwork, and understanding client needs. My roles at Le WAGON, TF1 and SPIDEO allowed me to extract insights from complex datasets, optimize production processes, and formulate strategic recommendations. I also further refined my skills in client relationship management and customized solution development. These experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a strong focus on delivering value-driven outcomes.

In my free time, I immerse myself in the world of cinema, captivated by its storytelling magic. But I'm not just a homebody—I love to travel too. Exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures is a big passion of mine. And even when I'm not on the go, I'm always eager to learn. I'm constantly seeking out new data analysis tools and techniques to sharpen my skills. It's fascinating to see how data can be used to understand the world around us better. Whether I'm collaborating with others or working independently, I get a real thrill from digging into data and uncovering fresh insights. There's something incredibly satisfying about using data to crack tough problems and make a real impact.
